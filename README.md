A flutter Mobile CV 
This app was built with flutter and it's routing and Navigation  is fully dependent on the bottom Navigation bar
When you open the app, you will see the profile summary screen, you can get the other 2 screens using the botttom navigator
I got the design inspiration from dribble. I modified it and here is the link to the original design https://dribbble.com/shots/14894936-CV-Mobile-App/attachments/6608074?mode=media

packages used:
font_awesome_flutter: ^10.2.1 - for icons
  google_fonts: ^3.0.1 - for fonts 
  google_nav_bar: ^5.0.6 - for bottom navigation bar
  provider: ^6.0.4 - for the switcheable toggle for dark mode
  url_launcher: ^6.1.6 - to be able to push to my social media profiles
  
  If I had extra time, I'd have loved to finish up the language screen
I faced a couple of challenges ranging from the app crashing on build severally to overflow and so on, If I were to be given an extra time, I'd definitely fix it up.
